# OpenMAS 
A research and simulation library for multi-agent systems. The first version of this library is expected to publish before 2018/06/30.

This library is concerned to provide a set of easy-to-use simulation tools for researchers in fields such as multi-agent systems, multi-robot systems, wireless sensor networks, economic networks and ecological networks.

# Features

## agent-model support 
* single-integrator particles 
* double-integrator particles 
* self-propelled particles 
* general-linear models 
(The above models will provide in the first version of this library.) 
* user-defined nonlinear models 
* two-wheels cars 
* four-wheels cars 
* quad-rotors aircraft 
* fixed-wing aircraft 
* ships 
* satellites 
* walking humans 
* smart grids 
* sellers and consumers

## Communication capability support 
* sensors 
* wireless networks 
* random communication topologies 
* preset fixed communication topologies 
* switching communication topologies 
* time-varying communication topologies

## Visualization support 
* 2D animation 
* 3D animation 
* GIF files support 
* video files support

## Simulation methods support 
* Runge-Kutta methods 
* Fixed-step methods

## Multi-levels interface 
* Level-0 interface. In this level, we provide a template including a ode32 simulation template and a fixed-step template and the user can control all the variables and to build a novel system. 
* Level-1 interface. In this level, we provide a serious of common systems and the users just take care of the algorithm parts and get rid of the details of simulation details. 
* level-2 interface. In this level, we provide a set of common agents and users can only concentrating on the distributed protocols.
